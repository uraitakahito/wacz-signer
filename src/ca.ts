/**
 * The private CA and the signing identity.
 *
 * Everything here is deliberately local. A public CA cannot issue a
 * certificate that expired yesterday, or one for a domain nobody owns — which
 * makes the failure cases impossible to exercise against one. Those cases are
 * the ones worth testing, so signer issues its own.
 *
 * The timestamp authority is not here. signer ran its own until v0.5.0 and now
 * asks an external RFC 3161 authority for the timestamp (src/sign.ts; the
 * reason is in src/index.ts).
 *
 * Let's Encrypt's staging environment is not an alternative: its roots are
 * absent from every trust store on purpose, so signatures made under it fail
 * the chain stage while looking perfect everywhere else. That is a confusing
 * state to develop in, and it is exactly what py-wacz's "invalid" fixture is.
