# wacz-signer — local wacz-auth signing service.

# Multi-stage: build TypeScript in one image, ship dist/ plus its runtime
# dependencies and openssl in the next.
#
# The npm side is one package — commander, for the CLI. Nothing cryptographic
# comes from npm: key generation, certificates, digests, signatures and
# RFC 3161 are openssl invocations, and openssl comes from apt.

# node:26 no longer ships corepack — it was unbundled from Node in 25, so the
# image has neither corepack nor pnpm and a bare `corepack enable` dies with
# "corepack: not found". Install it, pinned, then enable: corepack is what reads
# `packageManager` from package.json, so the pnpm version stays declared once.

# The production tree, built in a stage of its own from nothing.
#
# Not `pnpm deploy`, which BrowserHive uses: that selects a project out of a
# workspace, and wacz-signer's pnpm-workspace.yaml declares no packages — it exists
# only for allowBuilds and enablePrePostScripts, so `deploy` stops with
# ERR_PNPM_NOTHING_TO_DEPLOY.
#
# Nor `pnpm install --prod` on top of the build stage: pruning rewrites a
# node_modules holding 146 dev packages, and committing that layer wedged the
# builder for twenty minutes with the install itself reporting "Done in 267ms".
# Installing into an empty stage writes one package and nothing else.

# that the runtime stage will not have.
